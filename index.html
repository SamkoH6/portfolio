            Hi! My name is Sam, and I'm an aspiring programmer with a passion
            for web development and data science. I've been coding since primary
            school and have been looking to better myself in the field since.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used to work as a Freelancer on
            <a href="Upwork.com" class="highlight-text">Upwork</a>, while in
            school, where I got to work on lots of projects in and outside of
            the tech industry. I got to learn how to build my personal brand and
            managed to create a solid profile and income. However, I decided to
            quit freelancing and focus on my personal projects, to pursue a
            programming carrer.
          </p>
          <p>
            My main focus these days is, actively learning new stacks, and
            creating complex
            <a class="highlight-text" onclick="scrollToSection('projects')"
              >coding projects</a
            >
            to refine skills. My portfolio showcases a diverse range of
            projects, including React, Angular and .NET web applications, which
            you can check out yourself bellow. They range from simple projects
            to get myself familar with the stack, to complex web application
            with real life usage.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am open to learning new technologies, and I am always looking for
            new opportunities to grow and learn. I am currently looking for an
            internship/job to further better skills and knowledge in the field.
            I work great in teams, and I am always looking to help out and
            learn. At the same time I am able to work on my own and deliver
            results.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not at the computer, I'm working out, playing the guitar,
            reading, driving around, relaxing with my dog or hanging out.
