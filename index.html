            <span class="highlight-text">Hi!</span> My name is Sam, and I'm an
            aspiring programmer with a passion for web development. I've been
            coding since primary school and have been looking to better myself
            in the field since.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked as a Freelancer on
            <a href="Upwork.com" class="highlight-text">Upwork</a>, where I got
            to work on lots of projects in and outside of tech. I got to learn
            how to build my personal brand and managed to create a solid
            profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            My long term contract was working as a web editor for The Million
            Roses. Among the short term contract, were for example working as a
            copywriter to write SEO content and language work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to step away from freelancing a bit and focus on my
            personal projects, to pursue a programming career.
          </p>
          <p>
            My main focus these days is, actively learning new stacks, and
            creating complex

            to refine skills. My portfolio showcases a diverse range of
            projects, which you can check out yourself bellow. I put only the

            I am open to learning new technologies, and I am always looking for
            new opportunities to grow and learn. I am currently looking for an
            internship/part-time job to further better skills and knowledge in
            the field. I work great in teams, and I am always looking to help
            out and learn. At the same time I am able to work on my own and
            deliver results.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I am willing to create a website for your businesse.

          <p>
            When I am not at the computer, I'm working out, playing the guitar,
            reading, driving around, relaxing with my dog or hanging out.
